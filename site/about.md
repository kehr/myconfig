# About MyConfig

MyConfig is a comprehensive macOS system configuration backup and restore tool designed specifically for developers and system administrators who need reliable, automated solutions for managing their development environments.

## üéØ Project Mission

Our mission is to eliminate the pain of setting up new development environments by providing a robust, secure, and intelligent backup solution that captures not just files, but the entire ecosystem of tools, configurations, and preferences that make each developer's setup unique.

## üöÄ Project History

### The Beginning
MyConfig started as a simple script to backup Homebrew packages and dotfiles. Over time, it evolved into a comprehensive system that understands the complex relationships between different tools and configurations in a modern development environment.

### Major Milestones

**Version 1.0** - Initial release with basic Homebrew and dotfiles support

**Version 1.3.0** - Major enhancement with:
- **8.9x Database Expansion**: Grew from 10 to 89 supported applications
- **CLI Tools Integration**: Added comprehensive detection for 50+ command-line tools
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 15-23% improvements across key metrics
- **Enhanced Security**: Advanced filtering and validation mechanisms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

MyConfig is built on several core principles:

### 1. **Intelligence Over Brute Force**
Rather than blindly copying files, MyConfig understands what each application needs and intelligently selects the right configurations while excluding sensitive data.

### 2. **Security by Design**
Every operation includes built-in security filtering to automatically exclude SSH keys, passwords, and other sensitive information.

### 3. **Extensibility**
The plugin architecture allows for easy extension to support new applications and use cases.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Awareness**
While optimized for macOS, the architecture supports future expansion to other platforms.
